# AcUtils

AcUtils is a high performance abstraction layer for [AccuRev](http://www.borland.com/en-GB/Products/Change-Management/AccuRev). It's an open source library written in C#, developed at Verizon and available 
on https://github.com/Verizon/AcUtils. AcUtils expands AccuRev's core product offering by way of [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) and the [.NET Framework](http://www.microsoft.com/net). As a strongly named 
(tamper resistant) assembly (AcUtils.dll), AcUtils provides a secure high level API to 
[AccuRev CLI commands](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/accurev/71/WebHelp/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm#href=AccuRev_User_CLI/the_accurev_program.html) 
by spawning their execution and converting the XML result into .NET objects. This allows the use of integrated development environments and programming languages with familiar constructs. 
AcUtils facilitates the development of ad hoc queries, custom applications, and pre/post operation triggers. It helps streamline administrative tasks and enables third-party integration.
