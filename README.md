AcUtils is a .NET Framework abstraction layer for AccuRev written in C#. This strong-named (tamper resistant) assembly (AcUtils.dll) provides a high level interface to AccuRev CLI commands by spawning their execution and converting the XML result into .NET objects. Complex tasks can be simplified and in-depth analysis achieved using LINQ to XML, for code that is more expressive, powerful, and maintainable. AcUtils provides high performance via async programming for background processing (responsive UIs) and concurrent code execution across multiple CPUs. As CLS-compliant, use it with any language that targets the .NET Framework, e.g., C#, VB.NET, C++/CLI, F#, Eiffel, IronPython, IronRuby, Windows PowerShell, etc. AcUtils includes full LDAP and multiple domain support, archival logging, date/time conversions, fewer version conflicts with side-by-side assemblies, and application configuration file support.
