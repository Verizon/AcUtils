AcUtils is a .NET Framework abstraction layer for AccuRev written in C#. This strong-named (tamper resistant) assembly (AcUtils.dll) provides a high level interface to AccuRev CLI commands by spawning their execution and converting the XML result into .NET objects. Complex tasks can be simplified and in-depth analysis achieved using LINQ to XML, for code that is more expressive, powerful, and maintainable. AcUtils provides high performance via async programming for background processing (responsive UIs) and concurrent code execution across multiple CPUs. As CLS-compliant, use it with any language that targets the .NET Framework, e.g., C#, VB.NET, C++/CLI, F#, Eiffel, IronPython, IronRuby, Windows PowerShell, etc. AcUtils includes full LDAP and multiple domain support, archival logging, date/time conversions, fewer version conflicts with side-by-side assemblies, and application configuration file support.

The AcUtils documentation is the compiled HTML help file AcUtils.chm. If the content does not appear in the main window when the file is opened, right-click on the file in Windows Explorer, select Properties, and click the Unblock button. Also, note that the file must reside on your machine, as it cannot be read over a network. (Or maybe it can, but I haven't figured that out.) Microsoft HTML Help is no longer supported by the company and has some rather quaint security features around it. However, it's still widely in use for documenting things of this sort.
